> Art 1
> Parties to this Convention shall **protect the dignity and identity of all human beings** and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, **respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine**.

C'è un pò una paura dell'uso improprio della scienza medica.

> Art 2
> **The interests and welfare of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of society or science**.

This is what we said many times over today.

> Art 5
> An intervention in the health field **may only be carried out after the person concerned has given free and informed consent to it**. This person shall beforehand be given **appropriate information** as to the purpose and nature of the intervention as well as on its consequences and risks.
> **The person concerned may freely withdraw consent at any time**.

> Art 6
> Where, according to law, a minor does not have the capacity to consent to an intervention, the intervention may only be carried out **with the authorisation of his or her representative** or an authority or a person or body provided for by law. The opinion of the minor shall be taken into consideration as an increasingly determining factor in proportion to his or her age and degree of maturity.
>
> Where, according to law, an adult does not have the capacity to consent to an intervention because of a mental disability, a disease or for similar reasons, the intervention may only be carried out with the authorisation of **his or her representative** or an authority or a person or body provided for by law. The individual concerned shall as far as possible take part in the authorisation procedure.

> Art 8
> When because of an emergency situation the appropriate consent cannot be obtained, any medically necessary intervention **may be carried out immediately for the benefit of the health of the individual concerned**.

> Art 9
> The **previously expressed wishes** relating to a medical intervention by a patient who is not, at the time of the intervention, in a state to express his or her wishes **shall be taken into account**.

Nota che "Shall be taken into account", quindi non è totalmente prescrittivo.

> Art 10
> Everyone has the right to **respect for private life** in relation to information about his or her health.
> Everyone is entitled to **know any information collected about his or her health**. However, the wishes of individuals **not to be so informed shall be observed**.
> In exceptional cases, restrictions may be placed by law on the exercise of the rights contained in paragraph 2 [the previous phrase] in the interests of the patient.

> Art 11
> Any form of discrimination against a person on grounds of his or her genetic heritage is prohibited.

> Art 12
> Tests which are predictive of genetic diseases or which serve either to identify the subject as a carrier of a gene responsible for a disease or to detect a genetic predisposition or susceptibility to a disease may be performed **only for health purposes or for scientific research** linked to health purposes, and subject to **appropriate genetic counselling**.

> Article 13
> **An intervention seeking to modify the human genome may only be undertaken for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic purposes** and only if its aim is not to introduce any modification in the genome of any descendants.

> Article 14
> The use of techniques of medically assisted procreation **shall not be allowed for the purpose of choosing a future child's sex**, except where serious hereditary sex-related disease is to be avoided.

> Article 16
> Research on a person may only be undertaken if all the following conditions are met:
> 1. there is no alternative of comparable effectiveness to research on humans;
> 2. the risks which may be incurred by that person are not disproportionate to the potential benefits of the research;
> 3. the research project has been approved by the competent body after independent examination of its scientific merit, including assessment of the importance of the aim of the research, and multidisciplinary review of its ethical acceptability;
> 4. the persons undergoing research have been informed of their rights and the safeguards prescribed by law for their protection;
> 5. the necessary consent as provided for under Article 5 has been given expressly, specifically and is documented. Such consent may be freely withdrawn at any time.

> Article 17
> Research on a person without the capacity to consent as stipulated in Article 5 may be undertaken only if all the following conditions are met:
> 1. the conditions laid down in Article 16, sub-paragraphs i to iv, are fulfilled;
> 2. the results of the research have the potential to produce real and direct benefit to his or her health;
> 3. research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out on individuals capable of giving consent;
> 4. the necessary authorisation provided for under Article 6 has been given specifically and in writing; and
> 5. the person concerned does not object

Germany did not sign or rectify this treaty due to this article: they believe it was too lax. They prohibit research on anyone who cannot provide conscious consent. They believe the practice to be a slippery slope.

> Article 18
> Where the law allows research on embryos in vitro, it shall ensure adequate protection of the embryo.
> The creation of human embryos for research purposes is prohibited.

What does "adequate protection of the embryo" mean? It seems that nobody knows. Comma 2 was disliked by the UK, saying the treaty was "Against research's best interest".
Also, there is no mention to what an embryo is defined as.

> Art 21
> The human body and its parts shall not, as such, give rise to financial gain.

> Art 22
> When in the course of an intervention any part of a human body is removed, it may be stored and used for a purpose other than that for which it was removed, only if this is done in conformity with appropriate information and consent procedures.
